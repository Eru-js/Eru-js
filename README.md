# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jerus, A software engineer that focuses on Front-End Web development.

I'm a person with many interests due to my curious mind.

As for my hobbies, I always explore the internet, watching movies, playing video games and spending some time with my partner and my dog.

I also explore different technologies around web development and implement what I learned in my personal projects.

I'm an INTP kind of person, tho I value my reserved personality, I also love having interesting conversations.
